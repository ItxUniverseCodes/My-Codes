# 🚀 PyDailyLab

A daily Python practice repository where I build small projects to strengthen problem-solving, logic building, and real-world coding skills.

## 🎯 Goal
To master Python by building projects — from simple scripts to more advanced applications — one day at a time.

Instead of just watching tutorials, I believe in:
- Learning by building
- Writing clean code
- Improving consistency
- Tracking progress publicly

## 📅 Structure

Each day contains:
- One Python file
- A small working project
- Clean and readable code
- Comments explaining logic (when necessary)

Example projects:
- Age Calculator
- Password Generator
- Number Guessing Game
- File Organizer
- Mini CLI Tools
- Basic Automation Scripts

## 🛠 Skills Being Practiced

- Core Python syntax
- Functions
- Loops & conditionals
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Modules
- OOP (as I progress)
- Problem-solving mindset

## 📈 Why This Repo?

As a Software Engineering student, I believe consistency beats intensity.

This repository is proof of:
- Discipline
- Growth
- Practical application of concepts
- Love for building

## 🌱 Long-Term Vision

This series will gradually move from:
Beginner → Intermediate → Real-world mini tools → Automation → AI integrations
